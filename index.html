            <h2>Overview and Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>'MyTrail' is a mobile application that is supposed to help people to choose destination of their journey
                and get prepared for it. The app should also serve as a great trip planner so the users could avoid the
                inconveniences and frustrations that might appear because of poorly- planned journey.
                In the initial stage of the project I created a scope where I defined subject (tourism), target audience
                (amateur hikers of any age) and purpose (hiking for leisure, not for professional purposes).
                <br> <b> Challenge: </b>Build a mobile application for amateur hikers who go hiking for leisure.

            <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>

            <div class="design-thinking-stages">
                <p>Within the whole design process, I was following the UCD (user-centered design) approach so my
                    decisions were supported by evidences I gathered through deliverables and techniques I used in the
                    project. <br>
                    I started the project from the Research: <br>
                    <b>Method: </b>Semi-structured interview <br>
                    <b>Participants: </b> People who go hiking from time to time<br>
                    <b>Quant.: </b>4 people<br>
                    The research is aimed at defining user’s behavior, needs and current pain points they have using
                    similar products. The research findings helped me to determine what opportunities may exist for
                    creating new digital product for planning hiking trips and how it is different from non-digital
                    planning.
                    <br>Some of the research findings:

            <h2>Synthesis</h2>
            <p>After the research was finished I started Synthesis process.
                I divided notes into chunks and then grouped them by themes. During this stage I used some
                techniques and frameworks for getting initial visual concepts, prioritizing features, such as
                Affinity mapping, Crazy8, Value vs Complexity Quadrat.<br> Also before starting ideate the
                features I reframed the insight statements (themes) into How Might We questions to turn those
                challenges into opportunities for design e.g. <b>“How Might We provide more relevant
                    information about the track and trip so hikers could more efficiently plan their journey”.</b> <br>

            <h2>Hi-Fi and Lo-Fi Prototyping </h2>
            <p>
                The process of prototyping was divided into two parts: Low-Fidelity Prototyping and High-Fidelity
                Prototyping. I used Figma as a prototyping tool including its assets and plugins. Also the
                <strong> Atomic Design </strong>method helped me to put together the design system which I used for
                hi-fi
                prototyping.
                After the hi-fi prototype was created I prepared it for handoff by exporting Figma designs to Zeplin
                with the style guides and all the elements included.

            <h2>Test: Validation, Usability, Feedback</h2>
            <p>Usability testing was one of the crucial parts of the design process.
                It was conducted remotely with the help of Usability guide. Five were involved in usability testing,
                they were supposed to follow the instructions and answer the questions. After competing usability test,
                some insights were discovered where the app is not entirely working well. I went through each session of
                Usability flow in Miro and mapped specific problems to areas where they were discovered. I noticed that
                users had problems with finding “map button” so I could draw my attention to where I should be
                addressing my design iteration.

            <p>As design is iterative process in the last step of the process it was important to review the project and
                look for issues and opportunities for improvement in accessibility and annotate the screens accordingly.
                This time I used Lookback platform for Usability Test. There were 10 participants who were asked to
                follow the provided instructions and give a feedback of their user flow. After the feedback was gathered
                some I made some amendments to make the design more usable.

            <h2>Case Study Checklist</h2>
            <p> &#9679;It took me 3 months to finish this end-to end process . On the first stage of investigation the
                research was conducted where necessary data was gathered , I interviewed four people and discovered what
                problems and pain points users have while preparing for hiking using apps, on the next stage of ideation
                there were used some techniques for getting more ideas and prioritizing features . After that
                low-fidelity prototype was made and the first usability test was conducted so I could see the
                limitations of current design and improve it . When improvement was done I started to develop
                high-fidelity prototype and after it the second usability test was done with the help of LookBack.
                <br> &#9679;Key activities of the project were Research, Affinity mapping building, feature
                prioritizing, low-fidelity prototyping, high-fidelity prototyping , usability test, iterations, scope
                defining and user flow providing.
                <br> &#9679; Users were confused by registering on the app
                <br> &#9679; 85%of users preferred solution A to solution B because of its improvements in usability
                from the original design
                <br> &#9679; Key decision that was made is upgrading a map with all the useful marks that users wanted
                to have on the app.
                I made the final design solution according to the gathered data and usability tests.
